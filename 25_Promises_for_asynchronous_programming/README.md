25. Promises for asynchronous programming

This chapter is an introduction to asynchronous programming via Promises in general and the ECMAScript 6 Promise API in particular. The previous chapter explains the foundations of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. You can consult it whenever there is something that you don’t understand in this chapter.

25.1 Overview
Promises are an alternative to callbacks for delivering the results of an asynchronous computation. They require more effort from implementors of asynchronous functions, but provide several benefits for users of those functions.

The following function returns a result asynchronously, via a Promise:

function asyncFunc() {
    return new Promise(
        function (resolve, reject) {
            ···
            resolve(value); // success
            ···
            reject(error); // failure
        });
}
You call asyncFunc() as follows:

asyncFunc()
.then(value => { /* success */ })
.catch(error => { /* failure */ });
25.1.1 Chaining then() calls
then() always returns a Promise, which enables you to chain method calls:

asyncFunc1()
.then(value1 => {
    // Success: use value1
    return asyncFunction2(); // (A)
})
.then(value2 => { // (B)
    // Success: use value2
})
.catch(error => {
    // Failure: handle errors of
    // asyncFunc1() and asyncFunc2()
});
How the Promise P returned by then() is settled depends on what its callback does:

If it returns a Promise (as in line A), the settlement of that Promise is forwarded to P. That’s why the callback from line B can pick up the settlement of asyncFunction2’s Promise.
If it returns a different value, that value is used to settle P.
If throws an exception then P is rejected with that exception.
Furthermore, note how catch() handles the errors of two asynchronous function calls (asyncFunction1() and asyncFunction2()). That is, uncaught errors are passed on until there is an error handler.

25.1.2 Executing asynchronous functions in parallel
If you chain asynchronous function calls via then(), they are executed sequentially, one at a time:

asyncFunc1()
.then(() => asyncFunc2());
If you don’t do that and call all of them immediately, they are basically executed in parallel (a fork in Unix process terminology):

asyncFunc1();
asyncFunc2();
Promise.all() enables you to be notified once all results are in (a join in Unix process terminology). Its input is an Array of Promises, its output a single Promise that is fulfilled with an Array of the results.

Promise.all([
    asyncFunc1(),
    asyncFunc2(),
])
.then(([result1, result2]) => {
    ···
})
.catch(err => {
    // Receives first rejection among the Promises
    ···
});
25.1.3 Glossary: Promises
The Promise API is about delivering results asynchronously. A Promise object (short: Promise) is a stand-in for the result, which is delivered via that object.

States:

A Promise is always in one of three mutually exclusive states:
Before the result is ready, the Promise is pending.
If a result is available, the Promise is fulfilled.
If an error happened, the Promise is rejected.
A Promise is settled if “things are done” (if it is either fulfilled or rejected).
A Promise is settled exactly once and then remains unchanged.
Reacting to state changes:

Promise reactions are callbacks that you register with the Promise method then(), to be notified of a fulfillment or a rejection.
A thenable is an object that has a Promise-style then() method. Whenever the API is only interested in being notified of settlements, it only demands thenables (e.g. the values returned from then() and catch(); or the values handed to Promise.all() and Promise.race()).
Changing states: There are two operations for changing the state of a Promise. After you have invoked either one of them once, further invocations have no effect.

Rejecting a Promise means that the Promise becomes rejected.
Resolving a Promise has different effects, depending on what value you are resolving with:
Resolving with a normal (non-thenable) value fulfills the Promise.
Resolving a Promise P with a thenable T means that P can’t be resolved anymore and will now follow T’s state, including its fulfillment or rejection value. The appropriate P reactions will get called once T settles (or are called immediately if T is already settled).
25.2 Introduction: Promises
Promises are a pattern that helps with one particular kind of asynchronous programming: a function (or method) that returns its result asynchronously. One popular technique for implementing such a function in JavaScript is to have it pass the result to a callback (“callbacks as continuations”):

asyncFunction(arg1, arg2,
    result => {
        console.log(result);
    });
Promises provide a better way of working with callbacks: Now an asynchronous function returns a Promise, an object that serves as a placeholder for the final result. Callbacks registered via the Promise method then() are notified of the result:

asyncFunction(arg1, arg2)
.then(result => {
    console.log(result);
});
Compared to callbacks as continuations, Promises have the following advantages:

No inversion of control: similarly to synchronous code, Promise-based functions return results, they don’t (directly) continue – and control – execution via callbacks.
Chaining is simpler: If then() detects that its callback triggered another asynchronous operation and returned a Promise, it returns that Promise. That means that you can immediately follow it with another then() method call:
  asyncFunction1(a, b)
  .then(result1 => {
      console.log(result1);
      return asyncFunction2(x, y);
  })
  .then(result2 => {
      console.log(result2);
  });
Composing asynchronous calls (loops, mapping, etc.): is a little easier, because you have data (Promise objects) you can work with.
Error handling: As we shall see later, error handling is simpler with Promises, because both exceptions and asynchronous errors are managed the same way.
Cleaner signature: With callbacks, the parameters of a function are mixed; some are input for the function, others are responsible for delivering its output. With Promises, function signatures become cleaner; all parameters are input.
The de-facto standard for JavaScript Promises is called Promises/A+ [1]. The ECMAScript 6 Promise API follows that standard.

25.3 A first example
Let’s look at a first example, to give you a taste of what working with Promises is like.

With Node.js-style callbacks, reading a file asynchronously looks like this:

fs.readFile('config.json',
    function (error, text) {
        if (error) {
            console.error('Error while reading config file');
        } else {
            try {
                const obj = JSON.parse(text);
                console.log(JSON.stringify(obj, null, 4));
            } catch (e) {
                console.error('Invalid JSON in file');
            }
        }
    });
With Promises, the same functionality is used like this:

readFilePromisified('config.json')
.then(function (text) { // (A)
    const obj = JSON.parse(text);
    console.log(JSON.stringify(obj, null, 4));
})
.catch(function (error) { // (B)
    // File read error or JSON SyntaxError
    console.error('An error occurred', error);
});
There are still callbacks, but they are provided via methods that are invoked on the result (then() and catch()). The error callback in line B is convenient in two ways: First, it’s a single style of handling errors (versus if (error) and try-catch in the previous example). Second, you can handle the errors of both readFilePromisified() and the callback in line A from a single location.

The code of readFilePromisified() is shown later.

25.4 Creating and using Promises
Let’s look at how Promises are operated from the producer and the consumer side.

25.4.1 Producing a Promise
As a producer, you create a Promise and send a result via it:

const p = new Promise(
    function (resolve, reject) { // (A)
        ···
        if (···) {
            resolve(value); // success
        } else {
            reject(reason); // failure
        }
    });
25.4.2 The states of Promises
Once a result was delivered via a Promise, the Promise stays locked in to that result. That means each Promise is always in either one of three (mutually exclusive) states:

Pending: the result hasn’t been computed, yet (the initial state of each Promise)
Fulfilled: the result was computed successfully
Rejected: a failure occurred during computation
A Promise is settled (the computation it represents has finished) if it is either fulfilled or rejected. A Promise can only be settled once and then stays settled. Subsequent attempts to settle have no effect.


The parameter of new Promise() (starting in line A) is called an executor:

Resolving: If the computation went well, the executor sends the result via resolve(). That usually fulfills the Promise p. But it may not – resolving with a Promise q leads to p tracking q: If q is still pending then so is p. However q is settled, p will be settled the same way.
Rejecting: If an error happened, the executor notifies the Promise consumer via reject(). That always rejects the Promise.
If an exception is thrown inside the executor, p is rejected with that exception.

25.4.3 Consuming a Promise
As a consumer of promise, you are notified of a fulfillment or a rejection via reactions – callbacks that you register with the methods then() and catch():

promise
.then(value => { /* fulfillment */ })
.catch(error => { /* rejection */ });
What makes Promises so useful for asynchronous functions (with one-off results) is that once a Promise is settled, it doesn’t change anymore. Furthermore, there are never any race conditions, because it doesn’t matter whether you invoke then() or catch() before or after a Promise is settled:

Reactions that are registered with a Promise before it is settled, are notified of the settlement once it happens.
Reactions that are registered with a Promise after it is settled, receive the cached settled value “immediately” (their invocations are queued as tasks).
Note that catch() is simply a more convenient (and recommended) alternative to calling then(). That is, the following two invocations are equivalent:

promise.then(
    null,
    error => { /* rejection */ });

promise.catch(
    error => { /* rejection */ });
25.4.4 Promises are always asynchronous
A Promise library has complete control over whether results are delivered to Promise reactions synchronously (right away) or asynchronously (after the current continuation, the current piece of code, is finished). However, the Promises/A+ specification demands that the latter mode of execution be always used. It states so via the following requirement (2.2.4) for the then() method:

onFulfilled or onRejected must not be called until the execution context stack contains only platform code.

That means that your code can rely on run-to-completion semantics (as explained in the previous chapter) and that chaining Promises won’t starve other tasks of processing time.

Additionally, this constraint prevents you from writing functions that sometimes return results immediately, sometimes asynchronously. This is an anti-pattern, because it makes code unpredictable. For more information, consult “Designing APIs for Asynchrony” by Isaac Z. Schlueter.

25.5 Examples
Before we dig deeper into Promises, let’s use what we have learned so far in a few examples.

Some of the examples in this section are available in the GitHub repository promise-examples.

25.5.1 Example: promisifying fs.readFile()
The following code is a Promise-based version of the built-in Node.js function fs.readFile().

import {readFile} from 'fs';

function readFilePromisified(filename) {
    return new Promise(
        function (resolve, reject) {
            readFile(filename, { encoding: 'utf8' },
                (error, data) => {
                    if (error) {
                        reject(error);
                    } else {
                        resolve(data);
                    }
                });
        });
}
readFilePromisified() is used like this:

readFilePromisified(process.argv[2])
.then(text => {
    console.log(text);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.log(error);
});
25.5.2 Example: promisifying XMLHttpRequest
The following is a Promise-based function that performs an HTTP GET via the event-based XMLHttpRequest API:

function httpGet(url) {
    return new Promise(
        function (resolve, reject) {
            const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
            request.onload = function () {
                if (this.status === 200) {
                    // Success
                    resolve(this.response);
                } else {
                    // Something went wrong (404 etc.)
                    reject(new Error(this.statusText));
                }
            };
            request.onerror = function () {
                reject(new Error(
                    'XMLHttpRequest Error: '+this.statusText));
            };
            request.open('GET', url);
            request.send();
        });
}
This is how you use httpGet():

httpGet('http://example.com/file.txt')
.then(
    function (value) {
        console.log('Contents: ' + value);
    },
    function (reason) {
        console.error('Something went wrong', reason);
    });
25.5.3 Example: delaying an activity
Let’s implement setTimeout() as the Promise-based function delay() (similar to Q.delay()).

function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        setTimeout(resolve, ms); // (A)
    });
}

// Using delay():
delay(5000).then(function () { // (B)
    console.log('5 seconds have passed!')
});
Note that in line A, we are calling resolve with zero parameters, which is the same as calling resolve(undefined). We don’t need the fulfillment value in line B, either and simply ignore it. Just being notified is enough here.

25.5.4 Example: timing out a Promise
function timeout(ms, promise) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        promise.then(resolve);
        setTimeout(function () {
            reject(new Error('Timeout after '+ms+' ms')); // (A)
        }, ms);
    });
}
Note that the rejection after the timeout (in line A) does not cancel the request, but it does prevent the Promise being fulfilled with its result.

Using timeout() looks like this:

timeout(5000, httpGet('http://example.com/file.txt'))
.then(function (value) {
    console.log('Contents: ' + value);
})
.catch(function (reason) {
    console.error('Error or timeout', reason);
});
25.6 Other ways of creating Promises
Now we are ready to dig deeper into the features of Promises. Let’s first explore two more ways of creating Promises.

25.6.1 Promise.resolve()
Promise.resolve(x) works as follows:

For most values x, it returns a Promise that is fulfilled with x:
  Promise.resolve('abc')
  .then(x => console.log(x)); // abc
If x is a Promise whose constructor is the receiver (Promise if you call Promise.resolve()) then x is returned unchanged:
  const p = new Promise(() => null);
  console.log(Promise.resolve(p) === p); // true
If x is a thenable, it is converted to a Promise: the settlement of the thenable will also become the settlement of the Promise. The following code demonstrates that. fulfilledThenable behaves roughly like a Promise that was fulfilled with the string 'hello'. After converting it to the Promise promise, method then() works as expected (last line).
  const fulfilledThenable = {
      then(reaction) {
          reaction('hello');
      }
  };
  const promise = Promise.resolve(fulfilledThenable);
  console.log(promise instanceof Promise); // true
  promise.then(x => console.log(x)); // hello
That means that you can use Promise.resolve() to convert any value (Promise, thenable or other) to a Promise. In fact, it is used by Promise.all() and Promise.race() to convert Arrays of arbitrary values to Arrays of Promises.

25.6.2 Promise.reject()
Promise.reject(err) returns a Promise that is rejected with err:

const myError = new Error('Problem!');
Promise.reject(myError)
.catch(err => console.log(err === myError)); // true
25.7 Chaining Promises
In this section, we take a closer look at how Promises can be chained. The result of the method call:

P.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
is a new Promise Q. That means that you can keep the Promise-based control flow going by invoking then() on Q:

Q is resolved with what is returned by either onFulfilled or onRejected.
Q is rejected if either onFulfilled or onRejected throw an exception.
25.7.1 Resolving Q with a normal value
If you resolve the Promise Q returned by then() with a normal value, you can pick up that value via a subsequent then():

asyncFunc()
.then(function (value1) {
    return 123;
})
.then(function (value2) {
    console.log(value2); // 123
});
25.7.2 Resolving Q with a thenable
You can also resolve the Promise Q returned by then() with a thenable R. A thenable is any object that has a method then() that works like Promise.prototype.then(). Thus, Promises are thenables. Resolving with R (e.g. by returning it from onFulfilled) means that it is inserted “after” Q: R’s settlement is forwarded to Q’s onFulfilled and onRejected callbacks. In a way, Q becomes R.


The main use for this mechanism is to flatten nested then() calls, like in the following example:

asyncFunc1()
.then(function (value1) {
    asyncFunc2()
    .then(function (value2) {
        ···
    });
})
The flat version looks like this:

asyncFunc1()
.then(function (value1) {
    return asyncFunc2();
})
.then(function (value2) {
    ···
})
25.7.3 Resolving Q from onRejected
Whatever you return in an error handler becomes a fulfillment value (not rejection value!). That allows you to specify default values that are used in case of failure:

retrieveFileName()
.catch(function () {
    // Something went wrong, use a default value
    return 'Untitled.txt';
})
.then(function (fileName) {
    ···
});
25.7.4 Rejecting Q by throwing an exception
Exceptions that are thrown in the callbacks of then() and catch() are passed on to the next error handler, as rejections:

asyncFunc()
.then(function (value) {
    throw new Error();
})
.catch(function (reason) {
    // Handle error here
});
25.7.5 Chaining and errors
There can be one or more then() method calls that don’t have error handlers. Then the error is passed on until there is an error handler.

asyncFunc1()
.then(asyncFunc2)
.then(asyncFunc3)
.catch(function (reason) {
    // Something went wrong above
});
25.8 Common Promise chaining mistakes
25.8.1 Mistake: losing the tail of a Promise chain
In the following code, a chain of two Promises is built, but only the first part of it is returned. As a consequence, the tail of the chain is lost.

// Don’t do this
function foo() {
    const promise = asyncFunc();
    promise.then(result => {
        ···
    });

    return promise;
}
This can be fixed by returning the tail of the chain:

function foo() {
    const promise = asyncFunc();
    return promise.then(result => {
        ···
    });
}
If you don’t need the variable promise, you can simplify this code further:

function foo() {
    return asyncFunc()
    .then(result => {
        ···
    });
}
25.8.2 Mistake: nesting Promises
In the following code, the invocation of asyncFunc2() is nested:

// Don’t do this
asyncFunc1()
.then(result1 => {
    asyncFunc2()
    .then(result2 => {
        ···
    });
});
The fix is to un-nest this code by returning the second Promise from the first then() and handling it via a second, chained, then():

asyncFunc1()
.then(result1 => {
    return asyncFunc2();
})
.then(result2 => {
    ···
});
25.8.3 Mistake: creating Promises instead of chaining
In the following code, method insertInto() creates a new Promise for its result (line A):

// Don’t do this
class Model {
    insertInto(db) {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { // (A)
          db.insert(this.fields) // (B)
          .then(resultCode => {
              this.notifyObservers({event: 'created', model: this});
              resolve(resultCode); // (C)
          }).catch(err => {
              reject(err); // (D)
          })
        });
    }
    ···
}
If you look closely, you can see that the result Promise is mainly used to forward the fulfillment (line C) and the rejection (line D) of the asynchronous method call db.insert() (line B).

The fix is to not create a Promise, by relying on then() and chaining:

class Model {
    insertInto(db) {
        return db.insert(this.fields) // (A)
        .then(resultCode => {
            this.notifyObservers({event: 'created', model: this});
            return resultCode; // (B)
        });
    }
    ···
}
Explanations:

We return resultCode (line B) and let then() create the Promise for us.
We return the Promise chain (line A) and then() will pass on any rejection produced by db.insert().
25.8.4 Mistake: using then() for error handling
In principle, catch(cb) is an abbreviation for then(null, cb). But using both parameters of then() at the same time can cause problems:

// Don’t do this
asyncFunc1()
.then(
    value => { // (A)
        doSomething(); // (B)
        return asyncFunc2(); // (C)
    },
    error => { // (D)
        ···
    });
The rejection callback (line D) receives all rejections of asyncFunc1(), but it does not receive rejections created by the fulfillment callback (line A). For example, the synchronous function call in line B may throw an exception or the asynchronous function call in line C may produce a rejection.

Therefore, it is better to move the rejection callback to a chained catch():

asyncFunc1()
.then(value => {
    doSomething();
    return asyncFunc2();
})
.catch(error => {
    ···
});
25.9 Tips for error handling
25.9.1 Operational errors vs. programmer errors
In programs, there are two kinds of errors:

Operational errors happen when a correct program encounters an exceptional situation that requires deviating from the “normal” algorithm. For example, a storage device may run out of memory while the program is writing data to it. This kind of error is expected.
Programmer errors happen when code does something wrong. For example, a function may require a parameter to be a string, but receives a number. This kind of error is unexpected.
25.9.1.1 Operational errors: don’t mix rejections and exceptions
For operational errors, each function should support exactly one way of signaling errors. For Promise-based functions that means not mixing rejections and exceptions, which is the same as saying that they shouldn’t throw exceptions.

25.9.1.2 Programmer errors: fail quickly
For programmer errors, it can make sense to fail as quickly as possible, by throwing an exception:

function downloadFile(url) {
    if (typeof url !== 'string') {
        throw new Error('Illegal argument: ' + url);
    }
    return new Promise(···).
}
If you do this, you must make sure that your asynchronous code can handle exceptions. I find throwing exceptions acceptable for assertions and similar things that could, in theory, be checked statically (e.g. via a linter that analyzes the source code).

25.9.2 Handling exceptions in Promise-based functions
If exceptions are thrown inside the callbacks of then() and catch() then that’s not a problem, because these two methods convert them to rejections.

However, things are different if you start your async function by doing something synchronous:

function asyncFunc() {
    doSomethingSync(); // (A)
    return doSomethingAsync()
    .then(result => {
        ···
    });
}
If an exception is thrown in line A then the whole function throws an exception. There are two solutions to this problem.

25.9.2.1 Solution 1: returning a rejected Promise
You can catch exceptions and return them as rejected Promises:

function asyncFunc() {
    try {
        doSomethingSync();
        return doSomethingAsync()
        .then(result => {
            ···
        });
    } catch (err) {
        return Promise.reject(err);
    }
}
25.9.2.2 Solution 2: executing the sync code inside a callback
You can also start a chain of then() method calls via Promise.resolve() and execute the synchronous code inside a callback:

function asyncFunc() {
    return Promise.resolve()
    .then(() => {
        doSomethingSync();
        return doSomethingAsync();
    })
    .then(result => {
        ···
    });
}
An alternative is to start the Promise chain via the Promise constructor:

function asyncFunc() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        doSomethingSync();
        resolve(doSomethingAsync());
    })
    .then(result => {
        ···
    });
}
This approach saves you a tick (the synchronous code is executed right away), but it makes your code less regular.

25.10 Composing Promises
Composing means creating new things out of existing pieces. We have already encountered sequential composition of Promises: Given two Promises P and Q, the following code produces a new Promise that executes Q after P is fulfilled.

P.then(() => Q)
Note that this is similar to the semicolon for synchronous code: Sequential composition of the synchronous operations f() and g() looks as follows.

f(); g()
This section describes additional ways of composing Promises.

25.10.1 Manually forking and joining computations
Let’s assume you want to perform two asynchronous computations, asyncFunc1() and asyncFunc2() in parallel:

// Don’t do this
asyncFunc1()
.then(result1 => {
    handleSuccess({result1});
});
.catch(handleError);

asyncFunc2()
.then(result2 => {
    handleSuccess({result2});
})
.catch(handleError);

const results = {};
function handleSuccess(props) {
    Object.assign(results, props);
    if (Object.keys(results).length === 2) {
        const {result1, result2} = results;
        ···
    }
}
let errorCounter = 0;
function handleError(err) {
    errorCounter++;
    if (errorCounter === 1) {
        // One error means that everything failed,
        // only react to first error
        ···
    }
}
The two function calls asyncFunc1() and asyncFunc2() are made without then() chaining. As a consequence, they are both executed immediately and more or less in parallel. Execution is now forked; each function call spawned a separate “thread”. Once both threads are finished (with a result or an error), execution is joined into a single thread in either handleSuccess() or handleError().

The problem with this approach is that it involves too much manual and error-prone work. The fix is to not do this yourself, by relying on the built-in method Promise.all().

25.10.2 Forking and joining computations via Promise.all()
Promise.all(iterable) takes an iterable over Promises (thenables and other values are converted to Promises via Promise.resolve()). Once all of them are fulfilled, it fulfills with an Array of their values. If iterable is empty, the Promise returned by all() is fulfilled immediately.

Promise.all([
    asyncFunc1(),
    asyncFunc2(),
])
.then(([result1, result2]) => {
    ···
})
.catch(err => {
    // Receives first rejection among the Promises
    ···
});
25.10.3 map() via Promise.all()
One nice thing about Promises is that many synchronous tools still work, because Promise-based functions return results. For example, you can use the Array method map():

const fileUrls = [
    'http://example.com/file1.txt',
    'http://example.com/file2.txt',
];
const promisedTexts = fileUrls.map(httpGet);
promisedTexts is an Array of Promises. We can use Promise.all(), which we have already encountered in the previous section, to convert that Array to a Promise that fulfills with an Array of results.

Promise.all(promisedTexts)
.then(texts => {
    for (const text of texts) {
        console.log(text);
    }
})
.catch(reason => {
    // Receives first rejection among the Promises
});
25.10.4 Timing out via Promise.race()
Promise.race(iterable) takes an iterable over Promises (thenables and other values are converted to Promises via Promise.resolve()) and returns a Promise P. The first of the input Promises that is settled passes its settlement on to the output Promise. If iterable is empty then the Promise returned by race() is never settled.

As an example, let’s use Promise.race() to implement a timeout:

Promise.race([
    httpGet('http://example.com/file.txt'),
    delay(5000).then(function () {
        throw new Error('Timed out')
    });
])
.then(function (text) { ··· })
.catch(function (reason) { ··· });
25.11 Two useful additional Promise methods
This section describes two useful methods for Promises that many Promise libraries provide. They are only shown to further demonstrate Promises, you should not add them to Promise.prototype (this kind of patching should only be done by polyfills).

25.11.1 done()
When you chain several Promise method calls, you risk silently discarding errors. For example:

function doSomething() {
    asyncFunc()
    .then(f1)
    .catch(r1)
    .then(f2); // (A)
}
If then() in line A produces a rejection, it will never be handled anywhere. The Promise library Q provides a method done(), to be used as the last element in a chain of method calls. It either replaces the last then() (and has one to two arguments):

function doSomething() {
    asyncFunc()
    .then(f1)
    .catch(r1)
    .done(f2);
}
Or it is inserted after the last then() (and has zero arguments):

function doSomething() {
    asyncFunc()
    .then(f1)
    .catch(r1)
    .then(f2)
    .done();
}
Quoting the Q documentation:

The Golden Rule of done vs. then usage is: either return your promise to someone else, or if the chain ends with you, call done to terminate it. Terminating with catch is not sufficient because the catch handler may itself throw an error.

This is how you would implement done() in ECMAScript 6:

Promise.prototype.done = function (onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    this.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
    .catch(function (reason) {
        // Throw an exception globally
        setTimeout(() => { throw reason }, 0);
    });
};
While done’s functionality is clearly useful, it has not been added to ECMAScript 6. The idea was to first explore how much engines can detect automatically. Depending on how well that works, it may to be necessary to introduce done().

25.11.2 finally()
Sometimes you want to perform an action independently of whether an error happened or not. For example, to clean up after you are done with a resource. That’s what the Promise method finally() is for, which works much like the finally clause in exception handling. Its callback receives no arguments, but is notified of either a resolution or a rejection.

createResource(···)
.then(function (value1) {
    // Use resource
})
.then(function (value2) {
    // Use resource
})
.finally(function () {
    // Clean up
});
This is how Domenic Denicola proposes to implement finally():

Promise.prototype.finally = function (callback) {
    const P = this.constructor;
    // We don’t invoke the callback in here,
    // because we want then() to handle its exceptions
    return this.then(
        // Callback fulfills => continue with receiver’s fulfillment or rejec\
tion
        // Callback rejects => pass on that rejection (then() has no 2nd para\
meter!)
        value  => P.resolve(callback()).then(() => value),
        reason => P.resolve(callback()).then(() => { throw reason })
    );
};
The callback determines how the settlement of the receiver (this) is handled:

If the callback throws an exception or returns a rejected Promise then that becomes/contributes the rejection value.
Otherwise, the settlement (fulfillment or rejection) of the receiver becomes the settlement of the Promise returned by finally(). In a way, we take finally() out of the chain of methods.
Example 1 (by Jake Archibald): using finally() to hide a spinner. Simplified version:

showSpinner();
fetchGalleryData()
.then(data => updateGallery(data))
.catch(showNoDataError)
.finally(hideSpinner);
Example 2 (by Kris Kowal): using finally() to tear down a test.

const HTTP = require("q-io/http");
const server = HTTP.Server(app);
return server.listen(0)
.then(function () {
    // run test
})
.finally(server.stop);
25.12 Node.js: using callback-based sync functions with Promises
The Promise library Q has tool functions for interfacing with Node.js-style (err, result) callback APIs. For example, denodeify converts a callback-based function to a Promise-based one:

const readFile = Q.denodeify(FS.readFile);

readFile('foo.txt', 'utf-8')
.then(function (text) {
    ···
});
denodify is a micro-library that only provides the functionality of Q.denodeify() and complies with the ECMAScript 6 Promise API.

25.13 ES6-compatible Promise libraries
There are many Promise libraries out there. The following ones conform to the ECMAScript 6 API, which means that you can use them now and easily migrate to native ES6 later.

Minimal polyfills:

“ES6-Promises” by Jake Archibald extracts just the ES6 API out of RSVP.js.
“Native Promise Only (NPO)” by Kyle Simpson is “a polyfill for native ES6 promises, as close as possible (no extensions) to the strict spec definitions”.
“Lie” by Calvin Metcalf is “a small, performant, promise library implementing the Promises/A+ spec”.
Larger Promise libraries:

“RSVP.js” by Stefan Penner is a superset of the ES6 Promise API.
“Bluebird” by Petka Antonov is a popular Promises library that conforms to Promises/A+ and is thus an alternative to ES6 Promises.
Q.Promise by Kris Kowal implements the ES6 API.
ES6 standard library polyfills:

“ES6 Shim” by Paul Millr includes Promise.
“core-js” by Denis Pushkarev, the ES6+ polyfill used by Babel, includes Promise.
25.14 Promises and generators
25.15 Next step: using Promises via generators
Implementing asynchronous functions via Promises is more convenient than via events or callbacks, but it’s still not ideal:

Asynchronous code and synchronous code work completely differently. As a consequence, mixing those execution styles and switching between them for a function or method is cumbersome.
Conceptually, invoking an asynchronous function is a blocking call: The code making the call is suspended during the asynchronous computation and resumed once the result is in. However, the code does not reflect this as much as it could.
The solution is to bring blocking calls to JavaScript. Generators let us do that, via libraries: In the following code, I use the control flow library co to asynchronously retrieve two JSON files.

co(function* () {
    try {
        const [croftStr, bondStr] = yield Promise.all([  // (A)
            getFile('http://localhost:8000/croft.json'),
            getFile('http://localhost:8000/bond.json'),
        ]);
        const croftJson = JSON.parse(croftStr);
        const bondJson = JSON.parse(bondStr);

        console.log(croftJson);
        console.log(bondJson);
    } catch (e) {
        console.log('Failure to read: ' + e);
    }
});
In line A, execution blocks (waits) via yield until the result of Promise.all() is ready. That means that the code looks synchronous while performing asynchronous operations.

Details are explained in the chapter on generators.

25.16 Promises in depth: a simple implementation
In this section, we will approach Promises from a different angle: Instead of learning how to use the API, we will look at a simple implementation of it. This different angle helped me greatly with making sense of Promises.

The Promise implementation is called DemoPromise. In order to be easier to understand, it doesn’t completely match the API. But it is close enough to still give you much insight into the challenges that actual implementations face.

DemoPromise is available on GitHub, in the repository demo_promise.

DemoPromise is a class with three prototype methods:

DemoPromise.prototype.resolve(value)
DemoPromise.prototype.reject(reason)
DemoPromise.prototype.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
That is, resolve and reject are methods (versus functions handed to a callback parameter of the constructor).

25.16.1 A stand-alone Promise
Our first implementation is a stand-alone Promise with minimal functionality:

You can create a Promise.
You can resolve or reject a Promise and you can only do it once.
You can register reactions (callbacks) via then(). It must work independently of whether the Promise has already been settled or not.
This method does not support chaining, yet – it does not return anything.
This is how this first implementation is used:

const dp = new DemoPromise();
dp.resolve('abc');
dp.then(function (value) {
    console.log(value); // abc
});
The following diagram illustrates how our first DemoPromise works:


25.16.1.1 DemoPromise.prototype.then()
Let’s examine then() first. It has to handle two cases:

If the Promise is still pending, it queues invocations of onFulfilled and onRejected, to be used when the Promise is settled.
If the Promise is already fulfilled or rejected, onFulfilled or onRejected can be invoked right away.
then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    const self = this;
    const fulfilledTask = function () {
        onFulfilled(self.promiseResult);
    };
    const rejectedTask = function () {
        onRejected(self.promiseResult);
    };
    switch (this.promiseState) {
        case 'pending':
            this.fulfillReactions.push(fulfilledTask);
            this.rejectReactions.push(rejectedTask);
            break;
        case 'fulfilled':
            addToTaskQueue(fulfilledTask);
            break;
        case 'rejected':
            addToTaskQueue(rejectedTask);
            break;
    }
}
The previous code snippet uses the following helper function:

function addToTaskQueue(task) {
    setTimeout(task, 0);
}
25.16.1.2 DemoPromise.prototype.resolve()
resolve() works as follows: If the Promise is already settled, it does nothing (ensuring that a Promise can only be settled once). Otherwise, the state of the Promise changes to 'fulfilled' and the result is cached in this.promiseResult. Next, all fulfillment reactions, that have been enqueued so far, are be triggered.

resolve(value) {
    if (this.promiseState !== 'pending') return;
    this.promiseState = 'fulfilled';
    this.promiseResult = value;
    this._clearAndEnqueueReactions(this.fulfillReactions);
    return this; // enable chaining
}
_clearAndEnqueueReactions(reactions) {
    this.fulfillReactions = undefined;
    this.rejectReactions = undefined;
    reactions.map(addToTaskQueue);
}
reject() is similar to resolve().

25.16.2 Chaining
The next feature we implement is chaining:

then() returns a Promise that is resolved with what either onFulfilled or onRejected return.
If onFulfilled or onRejected are missing, whatever they would have received is passed on to the Promise returned by then().

Obviously, only then() changes:

then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    const returnValue = new Promise(); // (A)
    const self = this;

    let fulfilledTask;
    if (typeof onFulfilled === 'function') {
        fulfilledTask = function () {
            const r = onFulfilled(self.promiseResult);
            returnValue.resolve(r); // (B)
        };
    } else {
        fulfilledTask = function () {
            returnValue.resolve(self.promiseResult); // (C)
        };
    }

    let rejectedTask;
    if (typeof onRejected === 'function') {
        rejectedTask = function () {
            const r = onRejected(self.promiseResult);
            returnValue.resolve(r); // (D)
        };
    } else {
        rejectedTask = function () {
            // `onRejected` has not been provided
            // => we must pass on the rejection
            returnValue.reject(self.promiseResult); // (E)
        };
    }
    ···
    return returnValue; // (F)
}
then() creates and returns a new Promise (lines A and F). Additionally, fulfilledTask and rejectedTask are set up differently: After a settlement…

The result of onFulfilled is used to resolve returnValue (line B).
If onFulfilled is missing, we use the fulfillment value to resolve returnValue (line C).
The result of onRejected is used to resolve (not reject!) returnValue (line D).
If onRejected is missing, we use pass on the rejection value to returnValue (line E).
25.16.3 Flattening
Flattening is mostly about making chaining more convenient: Normally, returning a value from a reaction passes it on to the next then(). If we return a Promise, it would be nice if it could be “unwrapped” for us, like in the following example:

asyncFunc1()
.then(function (value1) {
    return asyncFunc2(); // (A)
})
.then(function (value2) {
    // value2 is fulfillment value of asyncFunc2() Promise
    console.log(value2);
});
We returned a Promise in line A and didn’t have to nest a call to then() inside the current method, we could invoke then() on the method’s result. Thus: no nested then(), everything remains flat.

We implement this by letting the resolve() method do the flattening:

Resolving a Promise P with a Promise Q means that Q’s settlement is forwarded to P’s reactions.
P becomes “locked in” on Q: it can’t be resolved (incl. rejected), anymore. And its state and result are always the same as Q’s.
We can make flattening more generic if we allow Q to be a thenable (instead of only a Promise).


To implement locking-in, we introduce a new boolean flag this.alreadyResolved. Once it is true, this is locked and can’t be resolved anymore. Note that this may still be pending, because its state is now the same as the Promise it is locked in on.

resolve(value) {
    if (this.alreadyResolved) return;
    this.alreadyResolved = true;
    this._doResolve(value);
    return this; // enable chaining
}
The actual resolution now happens in the private method _doResolve():

_doResolve(value) {
    const self = this;
    // Is `value` a thenable?
    if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null && 'then' in value) {
        // Forward fulfillments and rejections from `value` to `this`.
        // Added as a task (vs. done immediately) to preserve async semantics.
        addToTaskQueue(function () { // (A)
            value.then(
                function onFulfilled(result) {
                    self._doResolve(result);
                },
                function onRejected(error) {
                    self._doReject(error);
                });
        });
    } else {
        this.promiseState = 'fulfilled';
        this.promiseResult = value;
        this._clearAndEnqueueReactions(this.fulfillReactions);
    }
}
The flattening is performed in line A: If value is fulfilled, we want self to be fulfilled and if value is rejected, we want self to be rejected. The forwarding happens via the private methods _doResolve and _doReject, to get around the protection via alreadyResolved.

25.16.4 Promise states in more detail
With chaining, the states of Promises become more complex (as covered by Sect. 25.4 of the ECMAScript 6 specification):


If you are only using Promises, you can normally adopt a simplified worldview and ignore locking-in. The most important state-related concept remains “settledness”: a Promise is settled if it is either fulfilled or rejected. After a Promise is settled, it doesn’t change, anymore (state and fulfillment or rejection value).

If you want to implement Promises then “resolving” matters, too and is now harder to understand:

Intuitively, “resolved” means “can’t be (directly) resolved anymore”. A Promise is resolved if it is either settled or locked in. Quoting the spec: “An unresolved Promise is always in the pending state. A resolved Promise may be pending, fulfilled or rejected.”
Resolving does not necessarily lead to settling: you can resolve a Promise with another one that is always pending.
Resolving now includes rejecting (i.e., it is more general): you can reject a Promise by resolving it with a rejected Promise.
25.16.5 Exceptions
As our final feature, we’d like our Promises to handle exceptions in user code as rejections. For now, “user code” means the two callback parameters of then().


The following excerpt shows how we turn exceptions inside onFulfilled into rejections – by wrapping a try-catch around its invocation in line A.

then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    ···
    let fulfilledTask;
    if (typeof onFulfilled === 'function') {
        fulfilledTask = function () {
            try {
                const r = onFulfilled(self.promiseResult); // (A)
                returnValue.resolve(r);
            } catch (e) {
                returnValue.reject(e);
            }
        };
    } else {
        fulfilledTask = function () {
            returnValue.resolve(self.promiseResult);
        };
    }
    ···
}
25.16.6 Revealing constructor pattern
If we wanted to turn DemoPromise into an actual Promise implementation, we’d still need to implement the revealing constructor pattern [5]: ES6 Promises are not resolved and rejected via methods, but via functions that are handed to the executor, the callback parameter of the constructor.


If the executor throws an exception then “its” Promise must be rejected.

25.17 Advantages and limitations of Promises
25.17.1 Advantages of Promises
25.17.1.1 Unifying asynchronous APIs
One important advantage of Promises is that they will increasingly be used by asynchronous browser APIs and unify currently diverse and incompatible patterns and conventions. Let’s look at two upcoming Promise-based APIs.

The fetch API is a Promise-based alternative to XMLHttpRequest:

fetch(url)
.then(request => request.text())
.then(str => ···)
fetch() returns a Promise for the actual request, text() returns a Promise for the content as a string.

The ECMAScript 6 API for programmatically importing modules is based on Promises, too:

System.import('some_module.js')
.then(some_module => {
    ···
})
25.17.1.2 Promises versus events
Compared to events, Promises are better for handling one-off results. It doesn’t matter whether you register for a result before or after it has been computed, you will get it. This advantage of Promises is fundamental in nature. On the flip side, you can’t use them for handling recurring events. Chaining is another advantage of Promises, but one that could be added to event handling.

25.17.1.3 Promises versus callbacks
Compared to callbacks, Promises have cleaner function (or method) signatures. With callbacks, parameters are used for input and output:

fs.readFile(name, opts?, (err, string | Buffer) => void)
With Promises, all parameters are used for input:

readFilePromisified(name, opts?) : Promise<string | Buffer>
Additional Promise advantages include:

Unified handling of both asynchronous errors and normal exceptions.
Easier composition, because you can reuse synchronous tools such as Array.prototype.map().
Chaining of then() and catch().
Guarding against notifying callbacks more than once. Some development environments also warn about rejections that are never handled.
25.17.2 Promises are not always the best choice
Promises work well for for single asynchronous results. They are not suited for:

Recurring events: If you are interested in those, take a look at reactive programming, which add a clever way of chaining to normal event handling.
Streams of data: A standard for supporting those is currently in development.
ECMAScript 6 Promises lack two features that are sometimes useful:

You can’t cancel them.
You can’t query them for how far along they are (e.g. to display a progress bar in a client-side user interface).
The Q Promise library has support for the latter and there are plans to add both capabilities to Promises/A+.

25.18 Cheat sheet: the ECMAScript 6 Promise API
This section gives an overview of the ECMAScript 6 Promise API, as described in the specification.

25.18.1 Promise constructor
The constructor for Promises is invoked as follows:

const p = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { ··· });
The callback of this constructor is called an executor. The executor can use its parameters to resolve or reject the new Promise p:

resolve(x) resolves p with x:
If x is thenable, its settlement is forwarded to p (which includes triggering reactions registered via then()).
Otherwise, p is fulfilled with x.
reject(e) rejects p with the value e (often an instance of Error).
25.18.2 Static Promise methods
25.18.2.1 Creating Promises
The following two static methods create new instances of their receivers:

Promise.resolve(x): converts arbitrary values to Promises, with an awareness of Promises.
If the constructor of x is the receiver, x is returned unchanged.
Otherwise, return a new instance of the receiver that is fulfilled with x.
Promise.reject(reason): creates a new instance of the receiver that is rejected with the value reason.
25.18.2.2 Composing Promises
Intuitively, the static methods Promise.all() and Promise.race() compose iterables of Promises to a single Promise. That is:

They take an iterable. The elements of the iterable are converted to Promises via this.resolve().
They return a new Promise. That Promise is a new instance of the receiver.
The methods are:

Promise.all(iterable): returns a Promise that…
is fulfilled if all elements in iterable are fulfilled.
Fulfillment value: Array with fulfillment values.
is rejected if any of the elements are rejected.
Rejection value: first rejection value.
Promise.race(iterable): the first element of iterable that is settled is used to settle the returned Promise.
25.18.3 Promise.prototype methods
25.18.3.1 Promise.prototype.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
The callbacks onFulfilled and onRejected are called reactions.
onFulfilled is called immediately if the Promise is already fulfilled or as soon as it becomes fulfilled. Similarly, onRejected is informed of rejections.
then() returns a new Promise Q (created via the species of the constructor of the receiver):
If either of the reactions returns a value, Q is resolved with it.
If either of the reactions throws an exception, Q is rejected with it.
Omitted reactions:
If onFulfilled has been omitted, a fulfillment of the receiver is forwarded to the result of then().
If onRejected has been omitted, a rejection of the receiver is forwarded to the result of then().
Default values for omitted reactions could be implemented like this:

function defaultOnFulfilled(x) {
    return x;
}
function defaultOnRejected(e) {
    throw e;
}
25.18.3.2 Promise.prototype.catch(onRejected)
p.catch(onRejected) is the same as p.then(null, onRejected).
